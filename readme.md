<h1>Ironhack TD</h1>

The rules of the game are the following:

1. At the start of the game, the player gets 4 towers placed in the map.
Each one of them has a different attack type ( so each one is more effective to a specific type of monster).
Also, the Player gets 50 starting gold to be able to upgrade one of them.

2. Each round, a horde of enemies spawn and walk across a path. Depending on their class, they are faster, more resistent or immune to certain damage types.

3. Every 9 rounds, instead of a horde of enemies, a Boss will spawn.

4. The player can select a tower with his mouse to start shooting with that tower. To shoot, he has to click a target where the shots will go.

5. For every enemy death, the Player gets 1 gold. The Player can use the gold to upgrade his towers or to build new ones.

6. The Player has 50 lives and loses 1 for every enemy that reaches the end of the path.
